abstract: |
  Resilience is the capacity of any system to maintain its function, structure and identity despite disturbances. Assessing resilience has been elusive due to high levels of abstraction that are difficult to empirically test, or the lack of high quality data required once appropriate proxies are identified. Most resilience assessments are limited to specific situation arenas, making comparision one of the unresolved challenges in resilience assessments. Here we show how leveraging comparative analysis can provide insights on how Arctic communities (N = 34) can best deal with social and environmental change. We found that the capacity to self-organize, combining different types of knowledge, and navigating change and uncertanty are sufficient conditions for Arctic communities whose livelihoods have been resilient, or for communities whose livelihoods have been transformed. Resilience can be lost when these features are absent even if communities nurture diversity. Our study provides an alternative perspective on how to assess resilience by leveraging comparsion across cases. It also identify governance patways to support adaptations and transformations in the Arctic, a geography with some of the most dramatic social and natural challenges to come.

# Introduction

[800w]

Resilience is the capacity of any system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, feedbacks, and therefore identity [@Anonymous:2016fv]. There are over 70 definitions of resilience [@Fisher:2015fj], making it a hard concept to grasp, to operationalize, and empirically ground. How does one measure resilience remains a non-trivial challenge and a key frontier of active research [@Liu:2020ku; @Gao:2016dn; @Scheffer:2009p4449].

Seminal and foundational work on resilience emerged from reflections about ecological stability [@Lewontin:1969vh] and the possibility that ecosystems can undergo regime shifts [@Holling:1973p6861]. Regime shifts are abrupt and persistent changes in the function and structure of systems [@Anonymous:2004bq]. Thus if regime shifts relate to the possibility that a system can exist in multiple configurations, resilience is the ability to keep a system within a particular configuration. They are two complementary sides of the same coin. Not surprisingly, early theoretical work attempting to operationalize resilience measures focused on metrics such as the size of the basin of attraction, its depth, slope, or proximity to the boundary that separate different regimes [@Clark:1975vj]. More recent endavours of approximating resilience from that perspective suffer from the problem of finding sufficient observables [@Liu:2013gg], or high quality data to characterize the multidimensional configurations of social-ecological systems [@Dakos:2015jt].

While resilience is often introduced in the context of ecological problems, its roots go beyond ecology. In fact, the use of the term in the social sciences precedes its use in ecology, and the ideas of multiple attractors would have not been possible without the development of bifurcation theory in mathematics almost a century and a half ago [@Poincare:1885ji]. Bifurcations have found applications in the theories of poverty traps already in the 1950s [@Bowles:2006hx], segregation in sociology by the 1970s [@Schelling:1969wm], and over the last half century in fields that span medicine, climate science, linguistics, finance or physics [@Sole:2011us], and of course social-ecological systems [@Scheffer:2009wl; @Anonymous:2004bq].

If these concepts are so widely used, why is it so hard to find good empirical proxies of resilience? One problem with the general applicability of these concepts is that applying it to different systems requires answering _a priori_ the questions of resilience of what to what? [@Carpenter:2014fw]. Doing so reduces the ability of comparing across systems. For example, one might successfully approximate the resilience of a cancer, but it does not mean one can use the same method or proxies to assess the resilience of climate, or not even a different type of cancer. Consequently, most resilience assessments have been centered around particular problems by particular actors (e.g. water management), and remain participatory consultations limited by the perceptions of participants. They are important exercises to generate shared knowledge of a management problem enabling communities to identify feedbacks, slow variables or potential leverage points for intervention [@ResilienceAlliance:2011vc; @Walker:2012wp; @Walker:2012ur]. However, more generic, cross-system approaches are needed [@Scheffer:2012cta; @Scheffer:2003p339; @Scheffer:2009p4449].

Time being a common dimension to any dynamical system lends itself for the development of generic proxies of resilience [@Scheffer:2009p4449], in particular recovery time [@Holling:1973p6861]. Complex systems when close to critical transitions leave statistical signatures on the time series of its state variables known as critical slowing down [@Strogatz:2014wo; @Scheffer:2012cta; @Scheffer:2009p4449]. It means that the system takes longer to recover after a small disturbance, which translates into increases in variance, autocorrelation, and skewness or flickering [@Scheffer:2009p4449; @Dakos:2015jt]. These methods however have some limitations. They can fail when dynamics are driven by stochastic processes [@Hastings:2018gy; @Hastings:2010p5336], and often require long time series to detect useful signals [@Dakos:2015jt]. Time-based metrics offer no insight into two important dimensions of resilience: adaptive and transformative capacities [@Anonymous:2016fv].

Here we propose a qualitative comparative method for upscaling resilience assessments. We study `r nrow(coords)` communities in the Arctic facing environmental and social challenges related to potential regime shifts in Arctic ecosystems, or socio-economic and political pressures opened by recent pathways of development (Fig \ref{fig:map}). We outline how leveraging the power of comparison enables extracting patterns that transcend individual case studies informing theory development, as well as potential management or governance arrangements. We hope our qualitative proposal complements current quantitative metrics that focus on recovery time by gaining insights about the ability to adapt and transform that define communities in the Arctic. But why the Arctic?

The Arctic is a region of the world where the resilience of communities is being tested at a extreme. Climate change alone is impacting Arctic ecosystems ~4 times faster than the rest of the globe [@Ford:2015hq]. Climate impact is greater than ice loss, fundamentally changing landscape and seascape connectivity, the flow of energy and nutrients, and structure and function of biological communities. The Arctic is also the scene of vast socio-economic changes and challenges [@Carson:2016ts]. The reduction of Arctic sea ice is opening the possibility for mining exploration and new international shipping routes [@Barnhart:2015cb; @Huntington:2015fx], increase in pollution [@Schroder:2017cq; @Law:2017cs] or changing conditions for fisheries and aquaculture [@Troell:2017di]. Securing basic food, water and energy, as well as diversifying economies, remain key human development challenges for Arctic communities [@Larsen:2015bj].

How can Arctic communities respond to these social and ecological challenges? Will they adapt and continue with their traditional livelihoods, or transform towards new social-ecological configurations?

# Methods

[600w]

To answer these questions we first revisited the literature on adaptive capacity and designed a coding scheme for capturing elements of resilience across case studies. We co-designed and co-developed a template to guide case study selection, literature reviews, and validation with experts. Then we applied qualitative comparative analysis to infer necessary and sufficient conditions for resilience, transformations or resilience loss in `r nrow(coords)` communities across the Arctic. Below we describe in detail each of these steps.

**Measuring adaptive capacity**: We draw inspiration from early conceptual developments on how to approximate adaptive capacity. Adaptability is related to the capacity to learn, combine experience and knowledge, innovate, and adjust responses and institutions to changing external drivers and internal processes [@Anonymous:2016fv]. Berkes et al [-@Berkes:2003wx] proposed a two-tier set of variables grouped around four key dimensions: i) learning to live with change and uncertainty (N), ii) nurturing diversity for reorganization and renewal (D), iii) combining different types of knowledge for learning (K), and iv) creating opportunities for self organization (S). We complemented the two-tier approach with a third-tier of variables (Fig \ref{fig:vars}) by combining recent developments on principles for building resilience [@Anonymous:2011iw] with expert knowledge elicitation. The refining of our third-tier of variables benefited from input and testing of preliminary case studies in the context of the Arctic Resilience Assessment [@Carson:2016ts].

The Arctic Resilience Assessment was commissioned by the Arctic council under the Swedish Ministry of Environment chairmanship of the council, and delivered under the US chairmanship. The assessment was lead by the Stockholm Resilience Centre and the Stockholm Environmental Institute. It builds on collaborations between the Arctic countries, Indigenous peoples in the region, and several observers that include NGOs and academic institutions. Table X presents the different interest groups represented in the process.

**Co-designing a case study template**: We initially designed a template to capture social-ecological dynamics from literature reviews and expert elicitation inspired by the Regime Shifts database [@Biggs:2018hx]. Our first template was however modified to incorporate the feedback, needs and priorities of the different actor involved (Table X). We modified and tested the gathering data tool through workshops and focus groups that took place in Washigton, Tromsø, Bodø, and Stockholm (2015-16). The group also guided our selection of case studies to prioritize their most acute needs, and secure an heterogeneous selection of studies across problem issues and geographies.

The template was designed to capture key aspects of resilience and adaptive capacity based on literature reviews. The coder assigns whether the social-ecological system is resilient if the main livelihoods of the communities described are maintained over time, despite social and ecological disturbances. A case is coded as transformation if a community shift their main source of livelihoods to a different set, but manages to continue developing within the same place. A case is coded as loss of resilience where the main livelihoods are lost, no new livelihoods are established, and symptoms of community collapse long last such as emigration, simplified local economies, high unemployment or high substance abuse (Fig \ref{fig:map}). When possible, the templates were validated by experts in the topics who suggested new literature sources or improve our interpretation of the initial review. All templates collected are available in <XYZ> data repository.

**Qualitative comparative analysis**: Based on the templates, we coded a matrix of presence / absence of the third-tier variables used as proxies of adaptive capacity (Fig \ref{fig:vars}). A category is coded as -1 if the evidence in the literature or expert elicitation suggest that the case lacks that dimension, 1 if the evidence suggest presence of the category, or 0 if there is no evidence available. We aggregated the scores at the first-tier level by summing across the the third-level categories. Qualitative comparative analysis was then used to investigate necessary and sufficient conditions for a case to be resilient, transformation, or loss of resilience.

Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is a method that leverage boolean algebra [@Boole:1854ww] and (fuzzy) set theory to investigate research questions with intermediate number of cases [@Ragin:2009te]. While its origins are rooted in political science and sociology [@Rihoux:2013jx], the method has found application in several social-ecological systems problems [@Crona:2015ii; @Anonymous:2013iw; @Basurto:2013ev]. In our analysis, the four dimensions for adaptive capacity [@Berkes:2003wx] were used as conditions, and the outputs were coded as resilience loss, transformation or resilience based on the templates. First, we calibrated thresholds for inclusion or exclusion using a logistic function where values lower than -2 were excluded, +2 included, and -0.5 was assumed to be maximum ambiguity. For example, if a case has a score >2 for variables under the category "_nurturing diversity for reorganization and renewal_", the case is set to belong to the set **D**, which is a shorthand for diversity; if the score was <2, it does not belong to the set, which in QCA is denoted as **d**. Throughout the paper, capital letters are used to denote belonging to a set or presence of a feature, and small caps used for its absence or negation.

Next, we computed subsets of necessary and sufficient conditions for each possible output and its negation. We used the truth table of our case studies --a cross tabulation of the number of cases in our sample against all possible combinations of conditions and outputs-- to perform boolean minimization and identify parsimonious, complex, and intermediate solutions. These solutions (or causal recipes in the literature) suggest combination of conditions that leads to an output (being resilient) to be true or false. In other words, it helps us identify which features increase adaptive capacity, and hence resilience, in the Arctic communities in our study. All the analysis was performed in `R` [REF] using the `QCA` package [REF]. 

# Results

1000w

The `r nrow(coords)` cases analysed showcase some of the challenges that Arctic communities are currently facing._ _The most common challenges across our case studies are XYZ. Countries distribution sentence. Time distribution sentence. TODO: Maybe change fig 1 to include time lines and a barplot with drivers?_

We tested different approaches for calibrating the data and found that a logistic function best tailored our data needs (Fig XX). Alternative approaches such as the empirical cumulative distribution function, or the totally fuzzy relative method, use the features of the underlying variable to set thresholds for the inclusion or exclusion to a set [REF]. These data driven approaches are agnostic to the meaning of variable values. But in our case, the values zero have special meaning, it shows the adaptive capacity features for which there is maximum ambiguity (Fig XX). The logistic function allow us to incorporate that knowledge into the calibration of fuzzy sets [REF] by setting thresholds for inclusion and exclusion as (2, -2) respectively, and maximum ambiguity as -0.5. The wider the inclusion / exclusion threshold ($>|2|$), the more fuzzy is the calibration. In the limit where the inclusion, exclusion, and ambiguity thresholds are the same, the data is not fuzzy anymore, but becomes crisp sets (only accepts values 0 or 1). The rest of our analysis is done with fuzzy sets because it leverage the diversity of features to cover many of the possible combinations of cases. A crisp set analysis does not converge given poor coverage in the truth table.

# Discussion
(1000w)

- Principles for building resilience didnt work.
- The aggregation by summing has the implicit assumption that all categories are equally weighted. That is, the researcher does not have an apriori bias or inclination to decide which variables could be more important than others for adaptive capacity. As theory develops, one could relax such assumption.
- Limited by literature. Eg. issues of gender.
